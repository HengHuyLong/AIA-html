            <h2>Sick Child Policy</h2>
            <p>
              Children in preschool are exposed to germs. We cannot completely
              prevent the spread of disease but this sick-child policy helps us
              reduce the spread of sickness and disease whenever possible for
              all children in AIA.
            </p>

            <p>
              1. We will not provide care for a sick child if the health of
              other children is at risk. Please keep your child home if he or
              she is sick. A child that is sick cannot participate in daily
              activities and routines and cannot be successful in group care.
            </p>

            <p>
              2. You must have a plan for back-up care when your child is
              excluded from AIA if you are not able to leave or stay at home
              from work to care for your sick child.
            </p>

            <p>
              3. Each morning we perform a quick health assessment on your
              child, as well as throughout the day.
            </p>

            <p>
              4. If a child is ill upon arrival, you will be asked to take the
              child home.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Children showing signs or symptoms of illness must remain at home.
            </h3>
            <br />

            <p>
              1. If your child becomes ill while in AIA, we will notify you so
              you can make arrangements to pick up your child as soon as
              possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              2. If you are not reachable we will contact one of the emergency
              contact persons to pick up your child. You must provide local
              emergency contacts and information on how to reach them in case of
              emergency.
            </p>

            <p>
              3. Your child will be made comfortable and offered a quiet place
              to rest until you arrive.
            </p>

            <p>
              4. If your child leaves another program or school during the
              regular school day due to illness, he or she may not attend our
              school that same day.
            </p>

            <p>
              5. We administer only nonprescription medications in AIA. You must
              give us written authorization to administer.
            </p>
            <p>
              6. You will be asked to pick up your child who has: <br />
              Fever with behavior changes or signs or symptoms of illness: an
              oral temperature over 37.8ºc or under the armpit (axillary)
              temperature over 38ºc <br />
              Diarrhea <br />
              Vomiting
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                **In cases of fever, diarrhea and/or vomiting, the child should
                not return to AIA until 24 hours have passed since the last sign
                of the symptom.
              </li>
              <li>- Sore throat or difficulty swallowing</li>
              <li>- Headache or stiff neck</li>
              <li>- Severe itching or rashes</li>
              <li>- Severe itching or rashes</li>
              <li>- Mouth sores</li>
              <li>- Significant tiredness, irritability, crying</li>
              <li>- Difficulty breathing, chronic coughing, or wheezing</li>
              <li>
                - Any contagious condition including ringworm, bedbugs, or pink
                eye
              </li>
              <li>- Unusual nasal discharge</li>
              <li>- Constant pain in the stomach</li>
              <li>- Behavior that seems slow, confused, disoriented</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <br />
              These symptoms may or may not be associated with a communicable
              illness. Without consultation from a healthcare professional, it
              is impossible to determine the nature of the illness. Therefore,
              you will need to pick up your child for further evaluation. You
              will be asked to bring a note from a doctor or healthcare
              professional stating that the child may return to child care when
              the illness is no longer contagious.
            </p>

            <p>
              We will notify all parents within 24 hours if a communicable
              disease is reported at AIA.
            </p>

            <h3>Emergency Medical Treatment</h3>
            <p>
              Parents are required to complete an emergency medical form for
              each child. In case of an accident or emergency, this form will be
              used to notify the designated contacts. Please be advised that
              those listed as alternative contacts must be available for the
              call during school hours. To ensure the best possible care for
              your child, please provide contacts that are in the immediate area
              and can respond quickly to an emergency situation.
            </p>

            <p>
              If none of the emergency contacts can be reached, the school will
              abide by the direction in the form or call emergency medical
              services as the situation dictates. Parents will be responsible
              for all costs of the medical treatment.
            </p>

            <h3>Accident/Unusual Incident Reporting</h3>
            <p>
              In the case of an accident, a complete report will be filed, and
              parents of all parties involved will be notified as quickly as
              possible. Copies of these reports can be made available upon
              request.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="policy-section" id="discipline">
            <h2>Discipline Policy</h2>
            <p>
              Our staff will strive to create an atmosphere of love and trust
              through warm, responsive, and positive care. We will use a variety
              of positive guidance methods such as reinforcing good behavior
              with sincere praise often. We will model good behavior as we treat
              the children with kindness, patience, and respect.
            </p>
            <p>
              Methods of discipline will not be humiliating, frightening or
              physically harmful to the children. Discipline will be consistent
              and individualized for each child. It shall be appropriate for the
              child's level of understanding and be directed toward teaching the
              child acceptable behavior and self-control. It will not be
              associated with food or rest. Children will not be labeled “bad or
              “mean” but encouraged to be kind, sharing, and helpful.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a problem arises, the staff will talk through the problem.
              They will explain to the child why he/she will not be allowed to
              act in a manner that would harm him/her, other people, or destroy
              property. The teacher will firmly but calmly stop the action
            </p>
            <p>
              When a child continually disturbs the group, will not pay
              attention, or bothers his/her neighbor, he/she will be removed to
              a chair where he/she can be observed by the teacher but not
              allowed to participate in the activities until he/she can return
              to the group with good behavior. On the playground, there is a
              designated area where the child will take “time out” until he can
              regain self-control, play safely, obey playground rules, and deal
              kindly with his/her friends. The length of time out will be one
              minute per age of the child.
            </p>
            <p>
              Good supervision and a concern for the well-being of the children
              are usually sufficient to maintain order in an early learning
              center. This is not to say that some children will not have
              adjustment problems. Usually time, patience, and help from parents
              and teachers can correct this. There may be a rare instance when a
              child will not adjust to or obey the center's guidelines and
              policies. In such a case, the Head Teacher will request that the
              parents place their child in another arrangement.

              of instruction but is not a requirement. Children who are 18
              months - 2 years are eligible for admittance to the pre-nursery
              class at the start of the school year if space permits. Children
              who are 2 - 3 years are eligible for admittance to the nursery
              classes at the start of the school year where spaces are
              available.
            </p>
            <p>
              For entry into K1 and up English and Chinese classes, AIA requires
              an entrance exam and interview by either the head teacher or
              teacher. These exams will determine which level the potential
              student will be assigned to. However, the assigned level will also
              take into account the age and social development of the student.
              The assigned grade level will be appropriate for the child and
              their mental, emotional, and academic growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              The final decision on placement rests with the Admissions Office
              in consultation with the head teacher

            <h2>Special Needs Child/Learning Support</h2>
            <p>
              A child is recognized as having special needs if he/she has a
              learning difficulty which requires special provision to be made of
              him/her. Some learning difficulties can be met within the school,
              but we recognize the importance of obtaining specialist expertise
              when required. If a large amount of one on one attention is
              needed, the school will require special assistance for the kid and
              may result in extra charge. Parents may be asked to remove their
              child if we are unable to provide the special services that they
              need. If a child's behaviors are harmful physically or mentally to
              others in their environment the school will be unable to offer
              services to them.

            <h2>Open Door Policy and Investigative Procedures</h2>
            <p>
              AIA has an open door policy. Parents are invited and welcome to
              visit the facility if requested. They are encouraged to talk with
              us about any questions or concerns they may have
            </p>
            <p>
              If they need to visit the school when their child is not present
              they must first call and set up an appointment with the Head
              Teacher or Director. The Head Teacher or Director will then escort
              the parent wherever they want or need to go. This information is
              given to them when they enroll their child and at various times
              during the year in newsletters that are sent home
            </p>
            <p>
              As childcare providers, we are ethically and morally obligated to
              report signs of abuse. These meetings will be kept private and
              will not be harmful or intimidating to the children involved with
              such investigations. Because we are a childcare facility, any
              necessary reports are required by law.

            <p>Notifications and Consent</p>
            <p>
              At least twice a year, the school staff will plan a field trip for
              our students. Field trip permission slips, including the date,
              purpose of the trip, times of departure from and return to the
              school, and name, street address & telephone number will be sent
              home well in advance of the planned excursion. Every student must
              have a written permission slip from his or her parent to
              participate. Parents are invited to join the class as chaperones
              if they would like to participate as well.
            </p>
            <p>Opt Out</p>
            <p>
              If you do not consent to let your child participate or a student
              does not return with a written permission slip, they will remain
              at the school and participate with one of the other classes.
              Because these events are carefully chosen with maximum learning
              experience and safety in mind, we encourage every student to
              participate.

            <p>
              Children are encouraged to play in the school's outdoor spaces as

              academic performance, social skills, and overall health. If the
              weather is hotter than 40 deg, children will play either in their
              classrooms or in one of our indoor play areas.

              keeping in mind that AIA encourages a respectful learning
              environment. Students will wear their indoor shoes when they are
              in school with the exception of when they are in PE class. Parents
              are to provide sport shoes with non-marking soles for PE class.

              Students either bring a packed lunch from home, or pre-order a set
              lunch from the school canteen. AIA serves a healthy and
              well-balanced hot lunch every day which usually consists of a
              protein, fruit, vegetables, rice, and a bowl of soup. These meals
              have been carefully planned to teach children how to eat a variety
              of food and to have a healthy diet. Please contact the school
              office for more information on how to order for your child.
            </p>
            <p>
              Children with special food requirements must provide their own

            <h3>Snacks</h3>
            <p>
              AIA provides a small snack for students every day which consists
              of seasonal fruit and biscuits. Your child may bring their own
              snacks as well. However, AIA has a Healthy Food policy which means
              that students may not bring carbonated drinks, caffeinated drinks,
              candy, or very sugary food.

              provide your child's classmates with a treat (e.g. cupcake,
              muffin, candy bar) on your child's special day. Please be sure to
              communicate your plans to classroom homeroom teachers a few days
              in advance and let them know if you will be bringing in treats or
              sending them with your child. (Please don't forget napkins where
              appropriate) Celebrations are usually linked to the regular snack
              or recess times so as not to interfere with instructional time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please keep in mind when sending any treats or snacks to school
              that many children suffer from food allergies. In particular,
              please try to avoid snacks that contain nuts, and check with your
              child's class teacher regarding any particular concerns for the
              class.

              AIA acknowledges the need for children to have extra-curricular
              activities which enhances their academic learning. Children who
              are in involved with sport, music, and arts are more likely to be

              within 10 school days of the payment due date.
            </p>
            <p>
              B. Tuition will be payable from the start date, prorated based on
              the number of school days if necessary. Students who start class
              late, less than 10 days, will pay the full tuition fee. This fee

              If there is a failure to make two consecutive payments or a

              student(s) to remain at home until the balance is paid, and
              repeated failure to make payments will mean the student(s) may be
              removed.
